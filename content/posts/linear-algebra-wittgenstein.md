## Abstract

This essay explores a conceptual analogy between Ludwig Wittgenstein's *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* and the structure of linear vector spaces in mathematics. It proposes that the limits of language, as discussed in the Tractatus, can be modeled as projections from a high-dimensional conceptual space into lower-dimensional communicative subspaces. Drawing on elements from formal logic, linear algebra, and epistemology, the paper interprets key Tractarian concepts such as totality (*Gesamtheit*) and the say/show distinction through the lens of mathematical transformation. The analogy offers a novel framework for understanding the irreducibility of thought into language, the indeterminacy of reference, and the structural instability of certain philosophical questions. Rather than offering a metaphysical solution, the essay argues that some longstanding philosophical problems are symptomatic of linguistic overload or semantic compression, rather than deep ontological mystery. This perspective aims to bridge philosophical analysis with formal reasoning, suggesting a hybrid methodology for investigating the architecture of meaning.

## 1. Introduction

In the early 20th century, Ludwig Wittgenstein began formulating the boundaries of meaningful communication—an intellectual journey that coincided in age and period with what might be a comparable phase in my own life. Deeply influenced by the formal logical systems developed by Frege and Russell, which are now foundational in modern mathematics education, Wittgenstein sought to explore not the relationship between logic and mathematics per se, but rather the connection between logic and the full range of human communicative structures. His aim was to understand how logical form extends beyond numerical formalism into the broader domain of meaning.

I do not claim to offer objectivity or perfection in what follows; such a claim would, in fact, contradict the exploratory nature of this essay itself. During my studies at Politecnico di Torino, I encountered for the first time a rigorous analytical educational framework. It was within this context that I began exploring almost by coincidence an intuitive parallel between the Linear Algebra course I was taking and Wittgenstein's *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*.

## 2. Language and Logic in the Tractatus

Before we begin, it is worth deconstructing the title of the book from which I will frequently quote: *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (commonly translated as "A Logical-Philosophical Treatise"). Although Wittgenstein wrote the book in German, he deliberately chose to title it in Latin. At first glance, this may appear as a conventional homage to classical tradition, but in reality, it carries a far deeper symbolic meaning.

Latin has long been positioned as the language of knowledge and universal reason. From the Renaissance onward, the foundational figures of natural science—Newton (*Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*), Descartes (*Meditationes de Prima Philosophia*), and Spinoza (*Ethica*)—all wrote their most influential works in Latin. The fact that these thinkers, writing from regions that now speak entirely different modern languages, all chose Latin is no coincidence. It reflects a belief in the universality of truth and the aspiration to transcend national and linguistic boundaries.

By titling his work in Latin, Wittgenstein implicitly signals that this book is not merely a collection of speculative reflections, but an attempt at constructing a formal framework for the nature of knowledge and communication itself. Yet, paradoxically, he chose to write the content in German—his native language—precisely because, in his view, language can never fully express an objective system. This apparent paradox—a universal title in Latin coupled with a content bound to the German language—reveals a tension at the heart of Wittgenstein's project: the desire to express the world universally will always remain bound by the limits of a particular language.

## 3. The Logical Structure of Thought

The term *logico* in the title of *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* carries more than a surface-level association with mathematics. For Wittgenstein, logic is not merely a system of formal operations; it is the purest structural relation that thought and language can establish with the world of facts. Just as the proposition $$2+2=4$$ holds universally regardless of empirical context, the Tractatus aims to reveal how linguistic propositions can reflect reality through formal structure alone.

Logic, for Wittgenstein, is not simply a mode of error-free reasoning; it is the very map of what is thinkable. It delineates the boundaries of intelligibility and defines the conditions under which a sentence can have meaning. In this view, logic is not a mere tool, but a space of possibility—a philosophical "vector space" in which certain conceptual connections are permitted, others excluded. Just as linear algebra defines which vectors can coexist or combine within a given dimensional space, Wittgensteinian logic defines which propositions can meaningfully describe the world. It governs not only what can be said, but more fundamentally, what can be thought.

At the time Wittgenstein composed the Tractatus, the intellectual climate of Europe was deeply shaped by the rise of logical positivism. Thinkers like Frege and Russell had already laid the foundations of a formal logical language that aspired to reflect the objective structure of reality. Wittgenstein was influenced by their systems, but he also sought to push the boundaries of logic itself—a project he describes concisely in Tractatus 4.113:

> "Die Philosophie begrenzt das bestreitbare Gebiet der Naturwissenschaft."
>
> *(Philosophy sets the limits of the disputable realm of the natural sciences) (Wittgenstein, 1922, 4.113).*

Many of philosophy's most persistent problems, I believe, may in fact stem not from the world itself but from the vagueness of the questions we pose. One of the most enduring epistemological heuristics—Occam's Razor—reminds us that when faced with competing explanations, the simplest one is often closest to the truth. Applied to philosophy, this principle suggests that conceptual clarity may resolve more than speculation ever could. They might emerge not from what we fail to understand about the world, but from how we misuse language in attempting to express what cannot be clearly formulated.

Wittgenstein famously concludes:

> "Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen."
>
> *("Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Proposition 7, Wittgenstein, 1922)*

## 4. Analogy with Linear Algebra

While reading the Tractatus, I could not help but perceive an intuitive correlation between key concepts in linear algebra—particularly the structure of vector spaces—and Wittgenstein's gradual reduction of conceptual scope through terms such as *Gesamtheit* (totality) and *Ding* (thing).

In this analogy, *Gesamtheit* may be likened to an **infinite-dimensional vector space**—a space that encompasses all possible facts and propositions. By contrast, our methods of communication can be thought of as mappings into **lower-dimensional subspaces**: finite and fixed in expressive capacity.

From a mathematical standpoint, we know that when a linear transformation projects vectors from a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one, linear dependence necessarily arises. In such cases, the matrix representing the transformation has determinant zero, resulting in infinitely many solutions—an underdetermined system.

Interpreted philosophically, this suggests that when we attempt to map certain intuitively grasped phenomena or experiences from everyday life into the space of language, a transformation occurs—much like a projection distorting the original shape of an object. Just as a shadow cannot preserve all the dimensions of the form it reflects, language too fails to fully capture the structure of what is being expressed. This limitation can render certain topics effectively unspeakable—not because they lack meaning, but because their form is lost in translation.

Despite this inherent loss, human languages have evolved strategies to approximate the full richness of experiential reality within their representational limits. Each utterance becomes a projection—not of a single point in conceptual space, but of an entire equivalence class of meanings. This analogy opens a path for reinterpreting Tractarian limits of language through the mathematical lens of projection and constraint. The newly formed space after projection comprises all the entities we can represent. Yet, as in all functional systems, form follows necessity: we must construct as large a representational space as our communicative needs and cognitive capacities allow. Many of the experiences that individuals consider deeply personal or even subjective have, in fact, been successfully encoded into shared conceptual language spaces.

## 5. Language, Culture, and Conceptual Spaces

Take, for instance, the French word *chance* (luck). At some point, French speakers noticed that certain repeated interactions among people yielded favorable outcomes more often than others. They assigned a name to this statistical tendency—*chance*—and in doing so, captured a nuanced, probabilistic intuition in a single, shared lexical unit. The act of naming thus dramatically increased communicative clarity. Imagine trying to describe "luck" without having a word for it.

By contrast, Turkish—despite its relatively low lexical density—is compensated by an exceptionally high degree of combinatorial expression. This stems in part from the oral traditions that shaped the language, where precise detail about how an event occurred needed to be conveyed. The most striking example is the distinction between the witnessed past tense (*-di*) and the inferred past tense (*-miş*), a grammatical structure that encodes epistemic source directly into the verb form.

Such distinctions point to deeper cognitive worlds. A French speaker and a Turkish speaker may never fully align in their modes of understanding because the structures of their languages shape distinct conceptual topologies. Their worlds differ because the boundaries of their languages differ. And yet, if they attempt to bring those worlds into dialogue, they may begin to co-create a broader shared space of understanding—a kind of conceptual union born not from sameness, but from translation.

## 6. Philosophical Instability and Conceptual Overload

In the realm of more complex philosophical problems, I am particularly drawn to questions that seem profound only because they are poorly posed—not because they touch deeper truths. Take, for example, the classic question: *"What is the meaning of life?"*

This question appears to contain a unified structure, but it is an entangled composite of loosely defined terms. To answer it meaningfully, one would have to deconstruct it into extremely fine-grained semantic units. The term "life" may refer to the full span of conscious experience. Yet even this definition hinges on ambiguous subcomponents such as "consciousness," "experience," and "duration."

As we attempt to define each layer more precisely, we enter a recursive process of linguistic refinement. At every scale of this refinement, an epistemic error is introduced—just as in numerical analysis, where approximations carry floating-point errors. If the accumulated imprecision in our conceptual vocabulary exceeds a certain threshold—akin to surpassing machine precision in computation—the entire question collapses under the weight of its internal noise.

Another example is the debate around free will. When broken down into smaller components through a physicalist or deterministic perspective, we are left with two dominant possibilities: either all events are fully determined by causal chains—as famously exemplified by Laplace's Demon, a hypothetical intellect that, knowing the position and momentum of every particle at a given moment, could predict the entire future of the universe (Laplace, 1814)—or randomness exists. But randomness, by definition, is ungovernable and thus incompatible with the notion of agency. Neither scenario logically justifies the full semantic weight of the term "free will."

Therefore, my suggestion is not that these questions are meaningless or unimportant, but rather that their persistent opacity arises from a mismatch between the complexity of the concepts and the limitations of our linguistic architecture. This is, ultimately, my own interpretation shaped by a background in mathematics and a developing engagement with philosophy. It does not aim to settle these debates, but to offer an alternative lens: perhaps these "deep" problems are not veils over hidden truths, but cracks in the language we use to seek them.

## 7. Referential Ambiguity and the Limits of Translation

However, the ambiguity inherent in communication is not limited to conceptual overload. Much like relative velocity in physics, communication depends on the choice of a reference frame. As Quine famously illustrated with the example of *gavagai*, the meaning of a word is entirely contingent on the context of reference. This epistemic instability echoes Wittgenstein's own skepticism about causal or logical inferences across unrelated states of affairs. As he writes:

> "Auf keine Weise kann aus dem Bestehen irgend einer Sachlage auf das Bestehen einer, von ihr gänzlich verschiedenen Sachlage geschlossen werden."
>
> *("In no way can we infer the existence of one situation from the existence of another that is entirely different from it.") (Tractatus, 5.135)*

Much like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle—where position and momentum cannot be simultaneously determined with complete accuracy (Heisenberg, 1927)—context in communication becomes so dependent on minute nuances that it can never be fully measured. However, this does not render communication meaningless. Just as physics still operates using probabilistic models, language too functions within error-tolerant ranges. Meaning may be distorted, but not destroyed.

While Quine (1960) argues for the indeterminacy of translation—suggesting that linguistic meaning has no fixed mapping to objective referents—my view slightly diverges: the instability of meaning may stem less from the plasticity of language and more from the instability of the referential anchor itself. We are not simply trapped in ambiguous language; we are navigating unstable contexts. Just as one can predict the likely orbital of an electron based on its energy level (Schrödinger, 1926), we can approximate the boundaries of meaning through shared conventions, pragmatic inference, and cultural context. Of course, this approximation has no exact methodology, which is precisely why, in ambiguous verbal domains like flirting or negotiation, some individuals are naturally more adept than others.

## Conclusion

The human mind is perhaps the most advanced system on Earth when it comes to detecting patterns—even across entirely unrelated inputs. This cognitive gift is double-edged: it allows us to form lifesaving intuitions, yet also leads us into the traps of false correlation. The belief that a day went better because one wore a blue shirt, or the evolutionary intuition that bright colors signal venom, both arise from this same cognitive engine—expressions along a spectrum between noise and insight.

My own analogy in this essay—the projection of conceptual structures through the lens of linear algebra—is, ultimately, a product of the same pattern-seeking faculty. I can only hope that it falls on the useful end of that spectrum: that it not only offers a clearer map of the boundaries of meaningful expression, but also contributes, however modestly, to the broader project of making the architecture of meaning more communicable.
