Welcome aboard the ship that sails between trivial pop culture, natural sciences, and eternal philosophical debates.\nBefore I start writing, I thought I should explain the basics: What will I write? Why am I doing this? And what I am expecting from it?\nWhat will I write?\nMostly, about everything that I find interesting. In my daily life, I constantly see strange correlations between science, linguistics, pop culture, and literature. So I thought to myself: I should turn these abstract thought processes into something concrete.\nEven if nobody reads it (which is likely—seriously, who reads blogs anymore? Come on.), it is still a nice way to remember the things that crossed my mind. Besides if we consider that the universe is just entropy constantly increasing—everything slowly falling into disorder and if we call this process “time”—then these acts of “saving the moment” have always fascinated me. Writing a sentence or taking a picture is, in a way, the most meaningful discovery in the world. It is our way of creating a little bit of order.\nWhat should you expect? Hopefully, something you never thought about before I have always been fascinated by people who can point out a perspective I never considered. I’d like to believe that I am that kind of person as well.\nMy writing will have a certain tone, but I always want to keep the banter alive.\nHowever, in this initial chapter, I would like to remind you that I am young. My thoughts can change. I might not believe any of these things in the future. I can never tell. So, if I ever become a person that people that I don’t know actually care about, let it be known: these are just my early drafts.\nFree Will\nOriginally, I planned to write an essay about Dark Souls 2, Nietzsche, and Dostoyevsky. However, I realized I need to read at least 10 books and a mountain of papers to do it justice, so I’ll take a raincheck on that. But stay tuned.\nInstead, in this essay, I would like to talk about Free Will and Why It Is So Important For Us.\nSee? Great start for a blog. Just some cozy Tuesday reading.\nThere are certain questions in life that offer practically zero utility, yet possess a theoretical gravity strong enough to paralyze us—or even drag us into depression. The prime example of this in modern philosophy is the age-old question: “Do we actually possess free will?”\nBut before we even attempt to discuss free will, I believe the most appropriate starting point is to perform a differential diagnosis: What symptoms must be present for free will to exist?\nI say this because, personally, I spent most of my life living with various assumptions. But as I get older and actually reflect on these things, I’ve started to realize that the beliefs I once held don’t even share the same plane of reality as the world we live in. Frankly, I’m now surprised I was ever able to believe in them at all. Free will is the perfect example of this.\nHowever, the argument for free will isn’t a monolith; it inherits multiple dimensions. To truly unravel this complexity, we must examine it through two specific lenses:\nThe Tractarian Dimension: Reflecting on Wittgenstein, we must ask if the concept of “free will” carries an internal contradiction within language itself.\nThe False Dilemma Fallacy: If the options presented to us are limited, is choosing among them a choice?\nI will explain further in this essay.\nTo define the existence of free will in my mind, I look for a specific condition: The possibility of choosing an action that offers me absolutely no utility.\nAnd I don’t mean “utility” in the shallow sense. Take altruism, for example. Giving away all my money might seem like a selfless act on the surface. But if my brain, conditioned by past experiences and social values, calculates that the moral meaning or spiritual satisfaction I gain from this act outweighs the financial loss, then it is no longer a “free” choice. It is essentially a transaction.\nIn that scenario, the decision has already been made by a hidden profit-loss algorithm running in the background of my subconscious. My “choice” is just the inevitable result of my history.\nThe Needle on the Moon: An Anime Analogy To visualize this “illusion of infinite choice,” we can look at a masterpiece of storytelling: Hunter x Hunter.\nConsider the duel between Isaac Netero and the Ant King, Meruem.\nNetero’s ability, the 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva, allows for a seemingly infinite combination of attacks. To any observer, Netero’s movements appear completely random, unpredictable, and free. It looks like chaos.\nBut Meruem approaches the fight not as a brawl, but as a board game (Gungi). Despite being only 20 days old, his supercomputer-like intellect realizes a terrifying truth about humanity: We are incapable of true randomness.\nMeruem notices that even a grandmaster like Netero has unconscious biases. He favors certain angles. He has a faint, rhythmic breathing pattern. He avoids specific combinations due to sub-perceptual habits formed over decades of training.\nMeruem describes decoding Netero’s pattern as “finding a single needle on the surface of the moon.”\nAnd he finds it.\nHe realizes that what Netero perceives as “free, instant choices” in the heat of battle are actually just complex algorithms running on a biological loop. Netero wasn’t choosing; he was executing a script written by his past. Once Meruem deciphered the algorithm, the “god” of martial arts became predictable.\nIf a super-intelligence can map out the “infinite” moves of a human soul just by observing its biases, can we really claim those moves were ever free?\nThen, we have the Randomness argument.\nFrom a modern scientific perspective, we accept that true randomness exists at the quantum scale. We can no longer invent Laplace’s Demon—that imaginary entity dreamed up by old positivist philosophers, capable of predicting the future by knowing the position of every atom—because quantum mechanics prohibits such certainty.\nThis brings us to the concept of Second-Degree Chaos.\nIn first-degree chaos (like the weather), the system does not care about your predictions. But in second-degree chaos, the system responds to the prediction itself, making the outcome even more random.\n(It is funny to realize that just by learning about neural connections right now, you are physically making a neural connection—which means you are making a neural connection about making a neural connection.)\nA classic example is the bank run: If everyone learns tomorrow that a bank might go bankrupt, everyone withdraws their money today, and the bank will collapse. The prediction creates the reality.\nSo, does this complexity mean that determinism fails to explain our lack of agency? Not quite.\nTechnically, yes, there was a statistical probability that I might not have chosen to write these words today. But that randomness is not the same as freedom. If my action is the result of a quantum fluctuation or a chaotic feedback loop, a roll of the cosmic dice, then it still has nothing to do with me.\nBeing a slave to cause-and-effect is one thing; being a slave to chaos is another. Neither feels like freedom.\nBut is this actually a problem?\nDoes the absence of free will really make a difference within a naturalistic framework? Even if we can discuss these topics theoretically, it is obvious that, practically, human beings are incapable of truly believing in the absence of their own agency.\nIn 2010, Princeton psychologists Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler published a study titled “People believe they have more free will than others.” The study essentially revealed a serious asymmetry in how we view our own free will versus that of others.\nBecause we have access to our own internal monologue, we see infinite parameters and variables when predicting our own future. We view our path as ambiguous and full of potential. However, we assume the people around us are much shallower. For instance, when waiters were asked to predict their futures, they gave wildly diverse and ambitious answers for themselves. But when asked about their colleagues, they predicted that they would likely stay in the same line of work. We deem a superficial character analysis and a brief history sufficient to map out someone else’s fate, while reserving the “mystery” for ourselves.\nHowever, the existence of determinism leads to a much more significant gloom for those with a theistic worldview—those who believe their choices in this life determine their standing in the next. This is where the “Poker Game” metaphor becomes terrifying. It is one thing for a Creator to deal you a bad hand. But if “The House” also manipulates how you play that hand, the game itself becomes a cruel joke.\nBut here is the catch: Even for those of us who claim to have moved past that religious framework, the shadow of the past still lingers.\nOur collective subconscious is clouded by centuries of theological conditioning which taught us that meaning requires choice. We inherently feel that if an action isn’t “chosen,” it is devoid of value. Consequently, when we entertain the idea that we do not possess free will, we have a tendency to default immediately to nihilism. We assume that if we aren’t the authors of our story, the story isn’t worth reading.\nBut is it really important?\nDoes the mechanism of the choice actually devalue the experience of the choice?\nAs I said at the beginning of the article, in addition to the definitional impossibility of free will, there is also a free will that is hindered by practical obstacles. Free will constrained by other wills\nThe Illusion of Democracy and The Revolutionary’s Paradox This “absence of agency” scales up from the biological to the sociological.\nConsider the concept of democracy or the modern “American Dream.” We like to believe we are making free choices—which product to buy, which career to pursue, which politician to vote for. But are we?\nIn an era where we are constantly bombarded by what I call “Influence Bombs”—targeted algorithms, manufactured culture, and hyper-specific advertising—our “free will” is essentially being hacked. If a handful of people in Silicon Valley or Madison Avenue can manipulate my desires before I even formulate them, do I really have a political opinion, or do I just have a downloaded software update?\nThis leads us to the ultimate Second-Order Chaos in history: The Failure of Collective Action.\nLooking at history through a dialectical lens, one might expect the pendulum to eventually swing back toward collectivism or socialism due to rising inequality. But it doesn’t. Why? Because of a self-fulfilling prophecy rooted in rational selfishness.\nHere is the paradox: If I am a rational leftist today, I might look at the data and say, “A revolution won’t happen in my lifetime. The system is too strong, and the American Dream—however illusory—is too potent a drug for the masses.”\nSo, instead of acting, I decide to save myself. I focus on my own career, my own survival. But here is the catch: Everyone else makes the exact same calculation.\nBecause we all predict that “no one else will act,” nobody acts. The prediction of apathy causes the apathy. The pendulum stops swinging not because it lacks potential energy, but because the observers (us) have decided it won’t move.\nWe are trapped in a Nash Equilibrium of our own making, waiting for a history that we refuse to write.\nJustice and The Biological Alibi Now, let’s scale this up from the individual to the collective. Let’s talk about the Justice System.\nIf there is no free will, why are we punishing people?\nThose who watch House M.D. know the drill: When House wants to prove a patient is incompetent or strip them of their autonomy, he immediately checks their thyroid levels. He knows that a simple hormonal imbalance can completely hijack a person’s mood and decision-making. We have seen cases where a tumor the size of a needle pressing against the hippocampus causes a complete character shift.\nSo, here is the uncomfortable question: Where do you draw the line?\nIs there really a significant moral difference between a person being aggressive because they are “hangry” (hungry + angry) and a person being violent because of elevated thyroid levels? Both are biological inputs altering the behavioral output.\n(Put your pistols down, cowboy. I am not anti-jail.)\nI am not suggesting we abolish prisons because “nobody is guilty.” That would be chaos. But if we base the entire justice system solely on the premise of “Free Will,” the structure collapses under scientific scrutiny.\nThis is why we should pivot to the Social Contract.\nWhen a person goes to jail, we shouldn’t view it as metaphysical punishment for a “bad soul.” We should view it through the lens of evolutionary necessity. Human beings are social animals. To maintain our existence, harmony is not just a luxury; it is a survival requirement.\nWe do not punish a virus for being “evil”; we isolate it to protect the organism. Similarly, the law should be viewed as a mechanism of preservation, not retribution.\nThe Knight, The Clown, and The Wall For most of you, following this line of reasoning might have felt very grim. But should it be?\nThe debate of free will is not a solved case, and the answer is likely not a simple binary of “you possess it” or “you don’t.” But even if we assume we have zero impact on our destiny, why would that render life meaningless?\nThis brings me to Captain Ahab.\nMost people see him as a madman consumed by obsession. But I have always viewed Ahab as a healthy soul. Think about it: If Ahab had chosen to retire to a quiet life instead of chasing Moby Dick, his soul would have truly become crippled. The chase was his vitality.\nNo matter what the underlying reality is, we are experiencing these moments, and most of the time, I believe the experience itself is enough.\nThat is why, even in the end—when Ahab is strapped to the white whale, dragging into the depths of the Pacific, failing to kill his beast—I still imagine him feeling a profound sense of relief. He didn’t win, but he struck through the mask. As he famously said:\n“All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond. But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him.”\nTo me, realizing that Free Will might be an illusion is that wall.\nAnd perhaps the most beautiful summary of this struggle comes from the Turkish intellectual Şevket Süreyya Aydemir, who wrote:\n“Seek the source, the true source… You may reach it, or you may not. Or perhaps, thinking you have reached it, you will spend the rest of your life in this circus of existence waving a clown’s sword while believing yourself to be a knight. But even so, the path is still the path that leads to the source.”\nSo, whether we are knights or clowns, whether our choices are determined by quantum fluctuations or social engineering, the act of seeking is real.\nI choose to strike through the mask.\n“So if our paths happen to cross in the future, you should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want.”\n— Ging Freecss\nP.S. Writing about uniqueness and then choosing a Van Gogh painting? If you can calculate exactly which number I am in the line of “tortured souls using Prisoners Exercising,” send me an email.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p><strong>Hello lads.</strong>
Welcome aboard the ship that sails between trivial pop culture, natural sciences, and eternal philosophical debates.</p>
<p>Before I start writing, I thought I should explain the basics: What will I write? Why am I doing this? And what I am expecting from it?</p>
<p><strong>What will I write?</strong></p>
<p>Mostly, about everything that I find interesting. In my daily life, I constantly see strange correlations between science, linguistics, pop culture, and literature. So I thought to myself: I should turn these abstract thought processes into something concrete.</p>
<p>Even if nobody reads it (which is likely—seriously, who reads blogs anymore? Come on.), it is still a nice way to remember the things that crossed my mind. Besides if we consider that the universe is just entropy constantly increasing—everything slowly falling into disorder and if we call this process &ldquo;time&rdquo;—then these acts of &ldquo;saving the moment&rdquo; have always fascinated me. Writing a sentence or taking a picture is, in a way, the most meaningful discovery in the world. It is our way of creating a little bit of order.</p>
<p><strong>What should you expect?</strong> Hopefully, something you never thought about before I have always been fascinated by people who can point out a perspective I never considered. I&rsquo;d like to believe that I am that kind of person as well.</p>
<p>My writing will have a certain tone, but I always want to keep the banter alive.</p>
<p>However, in this initial chapter, I would like to remind you that I am young. My thoughts can change. I might not believe any of these things in the future. I can never tell. So, if I ever become a person that people that I don&rsquo;t know actually care about, let it be known: these are just my early drafts.</p>
<p><strong>Free Will</strong></p>
<p>Originally, I planned to write an essay about Dark Souls 2, Nietzsche, and Dostoyevsky. However, I realized I need to read at least 10 books and a mountain of papers to do it justice, so I’ll take a raincheck on that. But stay tuned.</p>
<p>Instead, in this essay, I would like to talk about Free Will and Why It Is So Important For Us.</p>
<p>See? Great start for a blog. Just some cozy Tuesday reading.</p>
<p>There are certain questions in life that offer practically zero utility, yet possess a theoretical gravity strong enough to paralyze us—or even drag us into depression. The prime example of this in modern philosophy is the age-old question: &ldquo;Do we actually possess free will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before we even attempt to discuss free will, I believe the most appropriate starting point is to perform a differential diagnosis: What symptoms must be present for free will to exist?</p>
<p>I say this because, personally, I spent most of my life living with various assumptions. But as I get older and actually reflect on these things, I’ve started to realize that the beliefs I once held don&rsquo;t even share the same plane of reality as the world we live in. Frankly, I’m now surprised I was ever able to believe in them at all. Free will is the perfect example of this.</p>
<p>However, the argument for free will isn&rsquo;t a monolith; it inherits multiple dimensions. To truly unravel this complexity, we must examine it through two specific lenses:</p>
<p>The Tractarian Dimension: Reflecting on Wittgenstein, we must ask if the concept of &ldquo;free will&rdquo; carries an internal contradiction within language itself.</p>
<p>The False Dilemma Fallacy: If the options presented to us are limited, is choosing among them a choice?</p>
<p>I will explain further in this essay.</p>
<p>To define the existence of free will in my mind, I look for a specific condition: The possibility of choosing an action that offers me absolutely no utility.</p>
<p>And I don’t mean &ldquo;utility&rdquo; in the shallow sense. Take altruism, for example. Giving away all my money might seem like a selfless act on the surface. But if my brain, conditioned by past experiences and social values, calculates that the moral meaning or spiritual satisfaction I gain from this act outweighs the financial loss, then it is no longer a &ldquo;free&rdquo; choice. It is essentially a transaction.</p>
<p>In that scenario, the decision has already been made by a hidden profit-loss algorithm running in the background of my subconscious. My &ldquo;choice&rdquo; is just the inevitable result of my history.</p>
<p><strong>The Needle on the Moon: An Anime Analogy</strong>
To visualize this &ldquo;illusion of infinite choice,&rdquo; we can look at a masterpiece of storytelling: Hunter x Hunter.</p>
<p>Consider the duel between Isaac Netero and the Ant King, Meruem.</p>
<p>Netero’s ability, the 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva, allows for a seemingly infinite combination of attacks. To any observer, Netero’s movements appear completely random, unpredictable, and free. It looks like chaos.</p>
<p>But Meruem approaches the fight not as a brawl, but as a board game (Gungi). Despite being only 20 days old, his supercomputer-like intellect realizes a terrifying truth about humanity: We are incapable of true randomness.</p>
<p>Meruem notices that even a grandmaster like Netero has unconscious biases. He favors certain angles. He has a faint, rhythmic breathing pattern. He avoids specific combinations due to sub-perceptual habits formed over decades of training.</p>
<p>Meruem describes decoding Netero&rsquo;s pattern as &ldquo;finding a single needle on the surface of the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he finds it.</p>
<p><img alt="Gungi" loading="lazy" src="/images/meruem-gungi.gif"></p>
<p>He realizes that what Netero perceives as &ldquo;free, instant choices&rdquo; in the heat of battle are actually just complex algorithms running on a biological loop. Netero wasn&rsquo;t choosing; he was executing a script written by his past. Once Meruem deciphered the algorithm, the &ldquo;god&rdquo; of martial arts became predictable.</p>
<p>If a super-intelligence can map out the &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; moves of a human soul just by observing its biases, can we really claim those moves were ever free?</p>
<p>Then, we have the Randomness argument.</p>
<p>From a modern scientific perspective, we accept that true randomness exists at the quantum scale. We can no longer invent Laplace’s Demon—that imaginary entity dreamed up by old positivist philosophers, capable of predicting the future by knowing the position of every atom—because quantum mechanics prohibits such certainty.</p>
<p>This brings us to the concept of Second-Degree Chaos.</p>
<p>In first-degree chaos (like the weather), the system does not care about your predictions. But in second-degree chaos, the system responds to the prediction itself, making the outcome even more random.</p>
<p>(It is funny to realize that just by learning about neural connections right now, you are physically making a neural connection—which means you are making a neural connection about making a neural connection.)</p>
<p><img alt="Huh" loading="lazy" src="/images/house-md-huh.gif"></p>
<p>A classic example is the bank run: If everyone learns tomorrow that a bank might go bankrupt, everyone withdraws their money today, and the bank will collapse. The prediction creates the reality.</p>
<p><img alt="Bankrupt" loading="lazy" src="/images/declare-bankrupt.gif"></p>
<p>So, does this complexity mean that determinism fails to explain our lack of agency? Not quite.</p>
<p>Technically, yes, there was a statistical probability that I might not have chosen to write these words today. But that randomness is not the same as freedom. If my action is the result of a quantum fluctuation or a chaotic feedback loop, a roll of the cosmic dice, then it still has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>Being a slave to cause-and-effect is one thing; being a slave to chaos is another. Neither feels like freedom.</p>
<p>But is this actually a problem?</p>
<p>Does the absence of free will really make a difference within a naturalistic framework? Even if we can discuss these topics theoretically, it is obvious that, practically, human beings are incapable of truly believing in the absence of their own agency.</p>
<p>In 2010, Princeton psychologists Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler published a study titled “People believe they have more free will than others.” The study essentially revealed a serious asymmetry in how we view our own free will versus that of others.</p>
<p>Because we have access to our own internal monologue, we see infinite parameters and variables when predicting our own future. We view our path as ambiguous and full of potential. However, we assume the people around us are much shallower. For instance, when waiters were asked to predict their futures, they gave wildly diverse and ambitious answers for themselves. But when asked about their colleagues, they predicted that they would likely stay in the same line of work. We deem a superficial character analysis and a brief history sufficient to map out someone else&rsquo;s fate, while reserving the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; for ourselves.</p>
<p>However, the existence of determinism leads to a much more significant gloom for those with a theistic worldview—those who believe their choices in this life determine their standing in the next. This is where the &ldquo;Poker Game&rdquo; metaphor becomes terrifying. It is one thing for a Creator to deal you a bad hand. But if &ldquo;The House&rdquo; also manipulates how you play that hand, the game itself becomes a cruel joke.</p>
<p>But here is the catch: Even for those of us who claim to have moved past that religious framework, the shadow of the past still lingers.</p>
<p>Our collective subconscious is clouded by centuries of theological conditioning which taught us that meaning requires choice. We inherently feel that if an action isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;chosen,&rdquo; it is devoid of value. Consequently, when we entertain the idea that we do not possess free will, we have a tendency to default immediately to nihilism. We assume that if we aren&rsquo;t the authors of our story, the story isn&rsquo;t worth reading.</p>
<p>But is it really important?</p>
<p>Does the mechanism of the choice actually devalue the experience of the choice?</p>
<p>As I said at the beginning of the article, in addition to the definitional impossibility of free will, there is also a free will that is hindered by practical obstacles.  <strong>Free will constrained by other wills</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Illusion of Democracy and The Revolutionary’s Paradox</strong>
This &ldquo;absence of agency&rdquo; scales up from the biological to the sociological.</p>
<p>Consider the concept of democracy or the modern &ldquo;American Dream.&rdquo; We like to believe we are making free choices—which product to buy, which career to pursue, which politician to vote for. But are we?</p>
<p>In an era where we are constantly bombarded by what I call &ldquo;Influence Bombs&rdquo;—targeted algorithms, manufactured culture, and hyper-specific advertising—our &ldquo;free will&rdquo; is essentially being hacked. If a handful of people in Silicon Valley or Madison Avenue can manipulate my desires before I even formulate them, do I really have a political opinion, or do I just have a downloaded software update?</p>
<p>This leads us to the ultimate Second-Order Chaos in history: <strong>The Failure of Collective Action</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at history through a dialectical lens, one might expect the pendulum to eventually swing back toward collectivism or socialism due to rising inequality. But it doesn&rsquo;t. Why? Because of a self-fulfilling prophecy rooted in rational selfishness.</p>
<p>Here is the paradox: If I am a rational leftist today, I might look at the data and say, &ldquo;A revolution won&rsquo;t happen in my lifetime. The system is too strong, and the American Dream—however illusory—is too potent a drug for the masses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, instead of acting, I decide to save myself. I focus on my own career, my own survival. But here is the catch: Everyone else makes the exact same calculation.</p>
<p>Because we all predict that &ldquo;no one else will act,&rdquo; nobody acts. The prediction of apathy causes the apathy. The pendulum stops swinging not because it lacks potential energy, but because the observers (us) have decided it won&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>We are trapped in a <strong>Nash Equilibrium</strong> of our own making, waiting for a history that we refuse to write.</p>
<p><strong>Justice and The Biological Alibi</strong>
Now, let&rsquo;s scale this up from the individual to the collective. Let&rsquo;s talk about the Justice System.</p>
<p>If there is no free will, why are we punishing people?</p>
<p>Those who watch House M.D. know the drill: When House wants to prove a patient is incompetent or strip them of their autonomy, he immediately checks their thyroid levels. He knows that a simple hormonal imbalance can completely hijack a person&rsquo;s mood and decision-making. We have seen cases where a tumor the size of a needle pressing against the hippocampus causes a complete character shift.</p>
<p>So, here is the uncomfortable question: Where do you draw the line?</p>
<p>Is there really a significant moral difference between a person being aggressive because they are &ldquo;hangry&rdquo; (hungry + angry) and a person being violent because of elevated thyroid levels? Both are biological inputs altering the behavioral output.</p>
<p>(Put your pistols down, cowboy. I am not anti-jail.)</p>
<p>I am not suggesting we abolish prisons because &ldquo;nobody is guilty.&rdquo; That would be chaos. But if we base the entire justice system solely on the premise of &ldquo;Free Will,&rdquo; the structure collapses under scientific scrutiny.</p>
<p>This is why we should pivot to the <strong>Social Contract</strong>.</p>
<p>When a person goes to jail, we shouldn&rsquo;t view it as metaphysical punishment for a &ldquo;bad soul.&rdquo; We should view it through the lens of evolutionary necessity. Human beings are social animals. To maintain our existence, harmony is not just a luxury; it is a survival requirement.</p>
<p>We do not punish a virus for being &ldquo;evil&rdquo;; we isolate it to protect the organism. Similarly, the law should be viewed as a mechanism of preservation, not retribution.</p>
<p><strong>The Knight, The Clown, and The Wall</strong>
For most of you, following this line of reasoning might have felt very grim. But should it be?</p>
<p>The debate of free will is not a solved case, and the answer is likely not a simple binary of &ldquo;you possess it&rdquo; or &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; But even if we assume we have zero impact on our destiny, why would that render life meaningless?</p>
<p>This brings me to <strong>Captain Ahab</strong>.</p>
<p>Most people see him as a madman consumed by obsession. But I have always viewed Ahab as a healthy soul. Think about it: If Ahab had chosen to retire to a quiet life instead of chasing Moby Dick, his soul would have truly become crippled. The chase was his vitality.</p>
<p>No matter what the underlying reality is, we are experiencing these moments, and most of the time, I believe the experience itself is enough.</p>
<p>That is why, even in the end—when Ahab is strapped to the white whale, dragging into the depths of the Pacific, failing to kill his beast—I still imagine him feeling a profound sense of relief. He didn&rsquo;t win, but he struck through the mask. As he famously said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond. But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, realizing that Free Will might be an illusion is that wall.</p>
<p>And perhaps the most beautiful summary of this struggle comes from the Turkish intellectual <strong>Şevket Süreyya Aydemir</strong>, who wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Seek the source, the true source&hellip; You may reach it, or you may not. Or perhaps, thinking you have reached it, you will spend the rest of your life in this circus of existence waving a clown&rsquo;s sword while believing yourself to be a knight. But even so, the path is still the path that leads to the source.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, whether we are knights or clowns, whether our choices are determined by quantum fluctuations or social engineering, the act of seeking is real.</p>
<p>I choose to strike through the mask.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So if our paths happen to cross in the future, you should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll find the things more important than what you want.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>— Ging Freecss</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P.S. Writing about uniqueness and then choosing a Van Gogh painting? If you can calculate exactly which number I am in the line of &ldquo;tortured souls using Prisoners Exercising,&rdquo; send me an email.</p>
